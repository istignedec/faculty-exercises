# Course description
Data structures: skip-lists, self-organizing lists, sparse tables, balanced trees (rotations in trees, AVL trees, RB trees), multiway trees, B-trees, trie. Selected topics on optimization: dynamic programming, introduction to genetic algorithms, introduction to neural networks (backpropagation algorithm), linear programming and simplex algorithm. Operations on sets. Selected graph algorithms: graph traversals, depth first search (DFS), breadth first search (BFS), shortest paths, cycle detection and connectivity, spanning trees, Eulerian graphs, Hamiltonian graphs, matching and assignment problems.
