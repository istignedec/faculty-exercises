# Course description
The role of computers in analysis and design of technical systems is presented. The course describes error handling in computer calculations, linear system solving algorithms and numerical optimization algorithms, as well as evolutionary algorithms. The transient analysis formulations and methods are presented. The systems behaviour is analysed in regard of system stability and chaotic properties. The presented algorithms are evaluated in regard of their computational efficiency.
