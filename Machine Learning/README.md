# Course description
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the design of algorithms that improve their performance based on empirical data. It has become one of the most active and exciting areas of computer science research, in large part because of its wide-spread applicability, ranging from data mining and pattern recognition to robotics, computer vision, computational biology, and computational linguistics. This course gives an in-depth coverage of the theory and principles of machine learning, and gives an overview of machine learning applications. The course covers two main approaches to machine learning: supervised learning (classification and regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction).
