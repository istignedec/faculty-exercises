# Course description
Virtual environments are objects and spaces created as models on a computer and brought to life using 3D computer graphics. The applications reach into a wide variety of fields such as computer games, television, design, virtual prototyping, training, various types of simulation, information visualization, communications, marketing etc. The fundamental techniques of virtual environments are presented, including virtual scene modeling, rendering, intersection testing, collision detection and interaction. More advanced technologies are introduced and explained: virtual and augmented reality networked virtual environments, virtual environments on mobile platforms. Applications of these technologies are discussed, aiming to stimulate students to think of the opportunities opened by them.
